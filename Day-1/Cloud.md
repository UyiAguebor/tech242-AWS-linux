## Day 1 - Cloud

## What is Cloud Computing?

Definition: Cloud computing is a technology model that allows access to computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet, typically in a pay-as-you-go model.

## Quick History/Timeline of Cloud Computing:
- 1960s-1970s: The concept of cloud computing begins to take shape.
- 1990s: Telecommunications companies offer virtualized private network services.
- 2006: Amazon Web Services (AWS) launches Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), marking the beginning of modern cloud computing.
- 2009: Google and Microsoft enter the market with Google App Engine and Azure.
- 2010s: Cloud services become mainstream, with various providers offering a range of services.

## What Can You Do with Cloud Computing?
- Storage: Store and retrieve data.
- Compute Power: Run applications and services.
- Database Management: Manage and store data.
- Networking: Connect and run applications globally.
- Analytics: Analyze large datasets.
- Machine Learning: Implement machine learning models.

Store, run applications and services, database management, connect and run applications globally, analytics, machine learning.

## 4 Types of Cloud Services:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.(most control)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet.
- Function as a Service (FaaS): Enables running individual functions or pieces of code in response to events.

Advantages of on premisis
- they have complete controll of the hardware(Servers, Storage, Networking) and evertything that runs on them

Disadvantage
- more control means more responsibility and moore things to maintain

## More depth on types of cloud services
one step above on premises is IaaS
- provider manages networtking, storage, servers, Virtualization (Virtual machines) allocates resources to virtual machine.

one step above IaaS is PaaS
- provider manages Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking and you're responsible for Data Application
- if you have a situation where you dont want devs to worry about setting up the webserver software. we want devs to put their code somewhere to run

one step above IaaS is SaaS
- only thing you're responsible for is the data
- e.g office 365


## Different Models of Cloud Service:
- Public Cloud: Services are provided over the internet and shared among multiple customers.
- Private Cloud: Services are used exclusively by a single organization.
- Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private cloud services.
- Multi Cloud: a company utilizes different cloud computing services from different cloud providers.

Multi: run app with aws run database for app on azure. if one falls over traffic can be redirected to another cloud where the applicationa and database is running on.

Hyrbrid: keep db on prem but app runs in cloud =  hybrid

runtime: what is needed to run a database etc.
## Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud for Business:
 - Advantages:
    - Cost Savings
    - Scalability
    - Flexibility
    - Accessibility

- Disadvantages:
    - Security Concerns
    - Downtime Risks
    - Limited Customization
    - compliance and legal issues
    - potential dowtime

## OpEx vs CapEx:
- OpEx (Operational Expenditure): Ongoing, operational costs incurred to run a business (e.g., cloud service subscriptions).
- CapEx (Capital Expenditure): One-time expenses for purchasing physical assets (e.g., servers).

OpEx - operational costs.
CapEx - physical asset expenditure/capital

## Market Share Breakdown:

## 3 Largest Cloud Providers:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Known for extensive services and global infrastructure.
- Microsoft Azure: Recognized for integration with Microsoft products and enterprise solutions.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Emphasizes data analytics and machine learning.

## 4 Pillars of DevOps and Their Link to the Cloud:
- Collaboration: Cloud enables seamless collaboration among development and operations teams.
- Automation: Cloud platforms provide tools for automated provisioning and deployment. AWS workflow
- Continuous Integration: Cloud services support continuous integration pipelines.
- Monitoring and Feedback: Cloud platforms offer monitoring tools for real-time feedback.

## Case Studies on Cloud Migration/Usage:
- Netflix recognized early on that to meet the ever-increasing demands of its global audience, it needed a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective infrastructure. Traditional on-premises systems were insufficient to support the rapid growth and dynamic nature of its streaming service. Thus, Netflix decided to migrate its entire operations to the cloud, relying heavily on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## How Does Cloud Computing Work as a Business Model?
- Businesses pay for cloud services on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis.
- Scalable resources allow businesses to adapt to changing demands.
- Reduced upfront infrastructure costs and maintenance.

## What Do You Usually Need to Pay for When Using the Cloud?
- Compute Resources (CPU, RAM)
- Storage (Data Storage, File Storage)
- Network Usage (Data Transfer)
- Additional Services (Databases, Machine Learning, etc.)
