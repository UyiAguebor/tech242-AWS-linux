# CI/CD Pipeline

## Countinous Integration 

### Source -> Build

Devs merge/Commit code to a master branch multiple times a day, so we automate build and test process which gives feedback within a few minutes to avoid integration hell.

## Continous Delivery

### Source -> Build -> Test -> Human Intervention -> Production

Continous Delivery is an extension of  continous integration to make sure you can release new chnages to your customers quickly in a sustainable way.

on top of having automated your testing you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button.

## Continous Deployment

### Source -> Build -> Test -> Production

Continuous Deployment goes one step further than continous delivery essentially meaning there is no human intervention when your pipeline is released to your customers.

## What is a CI CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is all about automation

1. initiating code builds
2. automated testing
3. automated deployment to staging or production environment

1. Jenkins (open source)
2. CircleCi
3. TeamCity
4. Bamboo
5. GitLab

## Benefits to Jenkins
